Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.
At the moment, boto supports S3 (Simple Storage Service) and SQS (Simple
Queue Service) via the REST API's provided by those services.  The goal
is to support additional services in the future.

The goal of boto is to provide a very simple, easy to use, lightweight
wrapper around the Amazon services.  Not all features supported by the
Amazon Web Services will be supported in boto.  Basically, only those
features I need to do what I want to do are supported.  To the extent that
the features I need are the features that you need you may find boto useful.

Boto was written using Python 2.4.1 on Mac OSX.  It has also been tested
on Linux Fedora Core 4 using Python 2.4.1.  Boto requires no additional
libraries or packages other than those that are distributed with Python 2.4.1.

There is very little in the way of documentation for boto at this point in time.
The best way to see how it works is to look at the unit tests in the tests
directory of the distribution.
